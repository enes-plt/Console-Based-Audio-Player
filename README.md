Console-Based Audio Player via Java

This Java project is a console-based audio player that allows users to play, stop, and reset three different audio files interactively.
Users control the playback via simple commands entered into the console.

- P1: Play the first audio file ('Gully Dreams - Hanu Dixit.wav').
- P2: Play the second audio file ('Dance Of The Gypsies - Hanu Dixit.wav').
- P3: Play the third audio file ('Indecision - Dyalla.wav').
- S: Stop all playing audio files.
- R: Reset all audio files to the beginning.
- Q: Quit the program and close all audio clips.

This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts including file handling, exception handling, user input processing, audio management, control flow structures, and resource management.
It provides a practical example of how to build an interactive console application for audio playback.
