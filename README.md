Console-Based Audio Player via Java

This Java project is a console-based audio player that allows users to play, stop, and reset three different audio files interactively.
Users control the playback via simple commands entered into the console.

- Play Audio: Users can play any of the three provided audio files.
- Stop Audio: Users can stop the playback of all audio files.
- Reset Audio: Users can reset the playback position of all audio files to the beginning.
- Quit Program: Users can close the audio clips and exit the program.

This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts including file handling, exception handling, user input processing, audio management, control flow structures, and resource management.
It provides a practical example of how to build an interactive console application for audio playback.
